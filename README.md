# Hacettepe AI

Hacettepe AI is a dedicated AI assistant for Hacettepe University students, built with React. It leverages advanced technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Claude 3 Haiku model to provide fast, accurate, and reliable information. This project is designed to help students easily access university-related information.

The chatbot can answer queries related to Hacettepe University by utilizing the Claude 3 Haiku model and the scraped data from the university's website. Users can ask questions in their preferred language, and the chatbot will respond accordingly.

I used [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) to scrape the website of Hacettepe.
